- Need way to prevent other cores active in the kernel from accessing critical sections
  - Atomic operations with polling? Shouldn't have to wait long
  - Should also disable interrupts?
- memory management:
  - can get memory areas from linker script
  - can also get size of OS code from linker script
  - give 4k at a time to skiplist?
- Need to figure out setup steps for OS
  - initialize OS data structures
  - what to do after that?
- Need system call interface
  - system call instruction with number corresponding to function to call?
  - What system calls are needed?
