 * For memoy allocation, a skip list will be used with 4 different free lists:
 * 0 B, 16 B, 64 B, and 1024 B
 *
 * A block of memory greater than or equal to the size of the ith list will be
 * placed on that list and will point to the next item in that list. Each list
 * will be singly-linked and only contain free blocks of memory.
 *
 * For example: (* denotes NULL)
 *          ______     _______     ______     ______     ______     ______
 *    0 -->|      |-->|       |-->|      |-->|      |-->|      |-->|   *  |

 * Planned interface:
 *  1) ker_malloc:
 *    - params: size of memory, start, and end (range for where to get memory from)
 *      - allows kernel to only allocate a process memory in its address space
 *    - traverse free list until past start
 *    - find first free entry of sufficient size to allocate request
 *    - if exact match or leftover would be too small: allocate entire entry
 *    - else fragment entry, allocate first chunk
 *    - previous entries need to be updated to point to correct next entry
 *      - use 2 list_links objects, 1 behind the other
 *  2) ker_calloc:
 *    - params: size of memory, start, and end addresses
 *    - calls ker_malloc, zeroes out memory
 *  3) ker_realloc:
 *    - params: new size of memory, old pointer, start, and end addresses
 *    - if there is a block directly next to old one (and it fits), expand it
 *    - else, allocate new block, copy data over, and free old block
 *  4) ker_free:
 *    - params: pointer
 *    - find spot where block should go in free list
 *    - if contiguous with next block, merge with next block
 *    - if contiguous with previous block, merge with previous
 *    - else, make it a new block and insert into list, update pointers
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - Need minimum alloc size (size of size_t + size of void *) - in this case, 8 B
 *  - For processes allocating memory, may need functions that allocate requested
 *    size + header size, and the header stores the size of the memory allocated
 *    for convenient freeing by process (free would only need the pointer)
 *  - May need similar thing for realloc - inner function accepts old memory size
 *    as well as new memory size
 *  - Start location of allocable memory will be communicated by the linker script
 *    (by communicating end of memory used in the OS binary) and size will be
 *    computed from this
